Agile vs DevOps
The key difference between agile and devops based software development processes is that the former focuses more on accommodating constant changes whereas the latter focuses on continuous testing, delivery and deployment. Collaboration between the development and operations teams is crucial so that the dev team is not blocked. 

Define continuous integration' continuous delivery and continuous deployment:
Continuous Integration is the practice where developers merge the changes to the code base to the main branch as often as possible. These changes are validated by creating a build and then running automated tests against the build. 
Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI since it enables to deploy all the code changes to production environment manually after the changes have been merged and approved. 
Continuous Deployment takes the process of software develpoment and infra provision as an advancement than continuous delivery. Here, all code changes that pass the verification/testing steps at each stage in the pipeline are released to production automaticaly. This process is completely orchastrated using deployment tools/applications.

Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources, such as IT infrastructure or data center over the internet. Cloud computing enables businesses to operate from virtually anywhere and with more efficiency. Some benefits of cloud computing include; fast infra readiness & provision, sacalability, high availability, low operational  overhead, mobility, reliability, disaster recovery, and collaboration.

Difference b/w Git & Github
Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control software installed on local / client side system and is developed on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a web based service include tools which integrate with VCS like Git and serves as a remote repository for collaborstion. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using VCS like git.

Stages of Git
There are three satges of git VCS ...working directory, staging area and local repository. Git has three main states that code files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed.

3 methods of git reset
reset is the command we use when we want to move the repository back to a previous commit. The options or methods of git reset are --soft, --mixed , and --hard.
