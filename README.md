Agile vs DevOps
The key difference between agile and devops based software development processes is that the former focuses more on accommodating constant changes whereas the latter focuses on continuous testing, delivery and deployment. Collaboration between the development and operations teams is crucial so that the dev team is not blocked. 

Define continuous integration' continuous delivery and continuous deployment:
Continuous Integration is the practice where developers merge the changes to the code base to the main branch as often as possible. These changes are validated by creating a build and then running automated tests against the build. 
Continuous Delivery is an extension of CI since it enables to deploy all the code changes to production environment manually after the changes have been merged and approved. 
Continuous Deployment takes the process of software develpoment and infra provision as an advancement than continuous delivery. Here, all code changes that pass the verification/testing steps at each stage in the pipeline are released to production automaticaly. This process is completely orchastrated using deployment tools/applications.

Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources, such as IT infrastructure or data center over the internet. Cloud computing enables businesses to operate from virtually anywhere and with more efficiency. Some benefits of cloud computing include; fast infra readiness & provision, sacalability, high availability, low operational  overhead, mobility, reliability, disaster recovery, and collaboration.
